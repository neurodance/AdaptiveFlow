# Adaptive Flow

Adaptive Flow is an orchestration and workflow system, and also a framework for creating free, pluggable, portable connectors to support functional integration across multiple systems, tools, and MCP servers.
Adaptive Flow is intended to support integrated use of:
  a.	Multiple agent ensemble intelligent orchestration, initially based on magentic-one, the Microsoft copilot agent framework.
  b.	Rich APIs for supporting existing orchestration and workflow systems via adapters (starting with Azure Logic Apps and Power Platform connectors) and also for existing API management systems
